After several months of hard work, we can finally announce the release of React Flow version 10. Together with the new library version, we are also releasing the fully revised documentation that is now running with Docusaurus. Last but not least, we are releasing React Flow Pro, our new subscription model for React Flow. This post is meant to explain the details about everything that is new in React Flow version 10.
