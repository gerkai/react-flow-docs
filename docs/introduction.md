React Flow is a library for building node-based applications. These can be simple static diagrams or complex editors. You can implement custom node types and edge types and it comes with components like a mini-map and graph controls. The best way to start is to follow the [getting started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) or check out the [examples](https://reactflow.dev/examples).

## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming & panning behaviour and single and multi-selections of nodes and edges
- **Customizable:** Different [node](/docs/api/nodes/node-types) and [edge types](/docs/api/edges/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered and only those that are in the viewport are displayed
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](/docs/api/hooks/use-react-flow) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and [graph util functions](/docs/api/graph-util-functions)
- **Plugin Components:** [Background](/docs/api/plugin-components/background), [MiniMap](/docs/api/plugin-components/minimap) and [Controls](/docs/api/plugin-components/controls)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
