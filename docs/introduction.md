React Flow is a library for building node-based applications. These can be simple static diagrams or complex node-based editors. You can implement custom node types and edge types and it comes with components like a mini-map and graph controls. Feel free to check out the [examples](https://reactflow.dev/examples/) or read the [blog post](https://webkid.io/blog/react-flow-node-based-graph-library/) to get started.

## Key Features

- **Easy to use:** Seamless zooming & panning behaviour and single and multi-selections of elements
- **Customizable:** Different [node](/docs/api/node-types/) and [edge types](/docs/api/edge-types) and support for custom nodes with multiple handles and custom edges
- **Fast rendering:** Only nodes that have changed are re-rendered and only those that are in the viewport are displayed
- **Hooks and Utils:** [Hooks](/docs/api/hooks/useReactFlow) for handling nodes, edges and the viewport and graph [helper functions](/docs/api/helper-functions/)
- **Components:** [Background](/docs/api/components/background/), [MiniMap](/docs/api/components/minimap/) and [Controls](/docs/api/components/controls/)
- **Reliable**: Written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and tested with [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
