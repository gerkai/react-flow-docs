If you‚Äôre considering removing the attribution, we‚Äôd first like to mention:

**If you‚Äôre using React Flow at your organization and making money from it**, we rely on your support to keep React Flow developed and maintained under an MIT License. Before you remove the attribution, [see the ways you can support React Flow to keep it running](https://pro.reactflow.dev/pricing).

**Are you using React Flow for a personal project?** Great! Go ahead and remove the attribution. You can support us by reporting any bugs you find, sending us screenshots of your projects, and starring us on [Github](https://github.com/wbkd/react-flow). If you start making money using React Flow or use it in an organization in the future, we would ask that you re-add the attribution or sign up for one of our subscriptions.

Thank you for supporting the React Flow team ‚úåüèª
