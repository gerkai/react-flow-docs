title: Usage with State Management Library

In this guide we are explaining how you could use React Flow with the state management library [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand). We will build a little app where every node has a color chooser that updates the background color of the specific node. We are using Zustand internally, but of course you can also use any other library like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) or [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) for example. For this guide we expect you to know about the [core concepts](/docs/getting-started/core-concepts/) of React Flow and [custom nodes](/docs/guides/custom-nodes/).

As you might have seen in the previous guides and examples, React Flow can easily be used with a local state for handling the nodes and edges. When your app grows and you want to alter your state from within your nodes for examples, things can get messy. To avoid passing down functions through the node data field, you could add a React context or use a state management library as explained in this guide.

## Install Zustand

As mentioned above we are using Zustand in this example. Zustand is a bit like Redux, so you have a central store, actions to alter your state and hooks to access your state. You can install zustand via:

```sh
npm install --save zustand
```

## Create a Store

Zustand lets us create a hook for accessing our store easily. We put our `nodes` and `edges` and the `onNodesChange`, `onEdgesChange` and `onConnect` functions in the store in order to get the basic interactivity for our diagram.

import CodeViewer from '/src/components/CodeViewer';
const editorOptions = { editorHeight: 500, editorWidthPercentage: 45, wrapContent: true }

<CodeViewer activeFile="store.ts" codePath="api-flows/StateManagement" applyStyles={false} options={editorOptions} additionalFiles={['store.ts', 'nodes.ts', 'edges.ts']} isTypescript />

That's the basic setup. We now have a store with the nodes and edges that can handle the changes triggered by React Flow. When you take a look at the `App.tsx` file, you can see that its nice and clean. All the data and actions are now part of the store and can easily be accessed with the `useStore` hook.

## Add a Color Chooser Node

In this step we are doing two things: First we add a new `updateNodeColor` action to the store that lets us update the `data.color` field of a node and second we implement the `ColorChooserNode` component:

<CodeViewer activeFile="ColorChooserNode.tsx" codePath="api-flows/StateManagement2" applyStyles={false} options={editorOptions} additionalFiles={[ 'ColorChooserNode.tsx', 'store.ts', 'nodes.ts', 'edges.ts']} isTypescript />

You can now click on a color chooser and change the background of a node.
