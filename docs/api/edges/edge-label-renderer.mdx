Edges are SVG based. If you want to render more complex labels you can use the ` <EdgeLabelRenderer />` component to access a div based renderer. The `<EdgeLabelRenderer />` is a portal that renders the label in a div that is positioned on top of the edges. You can see an example usage of the component in the [edge label renderer example](/docs/examples/edges/edge-label-renderer/).

:::info
The `EdgeLabelRenderer` component is available in `reactflow` version **11.2** and higher.

:::caution Mouse events

The ` <EdgeLabelRenderer />` has no pointer events by default. If you want to add mouse interactions you need to set `pointerEvents: all` and add the class name `nopan` on the label or the element you want to interact with.
