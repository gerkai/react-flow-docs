The connection line is the line that gets drawn while you connect two nodes with each other.
You can adjust the connection line by using the props documented in the [`connection line options section`](/docs/api/react-flow-props/#connection-line-options). If you want to implement a custom connection line, you can pass a React component to the `connectionLineComponent` prop. The connection line component will receive the following props:

### Connection Line Component Props

import connectionlineProps from '../../../docs-data/custom-connection-line';

<PropItems props={connectionlineProps} />

<div style={{ marginBottom: 20 }} />

You can find an implementation in the [custom connection line example](/docs/examples/edges/custom-connectionline/).
