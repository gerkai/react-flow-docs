This example shows how you can automatically arrange nodes after adding items from a sidebar. This a common UI pattern for workflow editors and lets you create a flow quickly. For calculating the layout, the library [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre) is run every time a node is added. **Please note that dagre is not being actively maintained at the moment.**

Dependencies: [react-flow-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flow-renderer), [dagre](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre)
