Interactive example to demonstrate how you can navigate hierarchical data structures. You can click on a node to toggle the child nodes. The layout is done with [d3-hierarchy](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy) and the animations are implemented with [d3-timer](https://github.com/d3/d3-timer).

Dependencies: [react-flow-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flow-renderer), [d3-force](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-force), [d3-timer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-timer)
