This example demonstrates how you can achieve a drag and drop behaviour within React Flow. Other than the [Drag and Drop example](/docs/examples/interaction/drag-and-drop/) this shows how you can drag and drop existing nodes onto each other.

  additionalFiles={['initial-elements.js', 'style.css']}
/>
