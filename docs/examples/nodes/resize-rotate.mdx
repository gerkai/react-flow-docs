This example shows how to implement a [custom node](/docs/api/nodes/custom-nodes/) that can be resized and rotated using [moveable](https://daybrush.com/moveable/). It can be used as a starting point for building flow chart editors or diagrams where users can configure the size and rotation of the elements.

Dependencies: [react-flow-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flow-renderer), [moveable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moveable)
