import ProExampleViewer from '/src/components/ProExampleViewer';

This example shows how to implement a [custom node](/docs/api/nodes/custom-nodes/) that can render different shapes like a circle, diamond or hexagon that are commonly used in flow charts. The shape node can be configured with these options which are added to the node data object:

- `width`: number
- `height`: number
- `color`: string - the background color of the node
- `shape`: string - the shape that the node should render (circle, round-rect, hexagon, diamond, arrow-rect, database, triangle, parallelogram)

Dependencies: [react-flow-renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-flow-renderer)
